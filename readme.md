### Google Drive Image Search using Image Captioning

This repository contains a Python Flask Application that connects with your Google Drive and captions the images present in them. It enables you to fetch images from your Google Drive just by describing the image in a textual prompt.

This application Google Drive API from Google Cloud Platform to enable users to authenticate their Google Drive Access to the application.

Currently, I am facing issues in coming up with the authentication part. I am getting the authentication error when trying to run the application locally and I have provided the localhost's IP Adress in the Google Cloud Credentials and downloaded the client_secrets.json file and included in the application. But still I am getting the error and I am not able to clear it. If you found the error, please feel free to point it out. I'll learn to solve the error shortly.
